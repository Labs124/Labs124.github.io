I am a computer science cybersecurity major at CSUF and I am planning on graduating in 2029

## Favorite Labs from 120L 
* Lab 1 
This was one of my favorite labs I have done this year. It was my very first lab, so it got me started on coding. My favorite part about it was in the beginning, my partner and I struggled to open it, then the tutor showed us in 10 seconds. 

* Lab 10
This was also a very enjoyable lab for me. The partner I had for this lab made it very enjoyable because he taught me many things I did not know and just helped me out. In this lab we were dealing with modular programming.

* Lab 11
This lab was also not only enjoyable, but very important for my computer science journey. This is the first time we did object oriented programming. Me and my partner struggled in the beginning, but figured it out in the end.
